    Born in Boca Raton, Florida, Connor grew up in the four square miles of land colloquially called Delaware, where they measure currency in units of “Biden," weigh things in “DuPonts,” and can’t use last names in public because the subject of any gossip is likely to be within earshot at any given moment. While there, he spent an inordinate amount of time swimming, both losing some eyebrows to chlorine and qualifying for Junior National level meets along the way; his best event was the 200 butterfly. He currently studies biological engineering and computer science at MIT. He spends most of his time on several research projects in synthetic biology, which include one funded by DARPA within the Department of Defense and one aimed at combating devastating pest diseases in crops. <br>
    <br> Interests include sustainable agriculture & agtech, plants, and synthetic biolgy.
